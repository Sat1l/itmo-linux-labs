[?2004lArchitect:  Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatest weakness.
Neo:  If I were you, I would hope that we don’t meet again.
Architect:  We won’t.
Morpheus:  What is that?
Link:  Whatever it is, it’s moving faster than anything I’ve ever seen.
Link:  Shit, he caught her!
Trinity:  Neo, I had to.
Neo:  I know. The bullet is still inside.
Morpheus:  Trinity, don’t you quit on me now.

Neo:  Trinity. Trinity, I know you can hear me. I’m not letting go. I can’t. I love you too damn much.

[?2004lArchitect:  The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally perfect, it was a work of art – flawless, sublime. A triumph equalled only by its monumental failure. The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus, I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature. However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus the answer was stumbled upon by another – an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.
Neo:  The Oracle.
Neo:  This is about Zion.
Architect:  You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed – its every living inhabitant terminated, its entire existence eradicated.
Architect:  Denial is the most predictable of all human responses, but rest assured, this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and we have become exceedingly efficient at it.
Architect:  The function of the One is now to return to the Source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry, reinserting the prime program. After which, you will be required to select from the Matrix 23 individuals – 16 female, 7 male – to rebuild Zion. Failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash, killing everyone connected to the Matrix, which, coupled with the extermination of Zion, will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race.
Neo:  No.
Architect:  Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to your right leads to the Source, and the salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to the Matrix, to her and to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the problem is choice. But we already know what you are going to do, don’t we? Already, I can see the chain reaction – the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason – an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth. She is going to die, and there is nothing you can do to stop it.

[?2004lCouncillor Hamann:  That you are, in fact, still human. Have you ever been to the enginering level? I love to walk there at night, it’s quite amazing. Would you like to see it?
Neo:  Sure.
Councillor Hamann:  Almost no one comes down here, unless, of course, there’s a problem. That’s how it is with people – nobody cares how it works as long as it works. I like it down here. I like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines. These machines are keeping us alive, while other machines are coming to kill us. Interesting, isn’t it? Power to give life, and the power to end it.
Neo:  We have the same power.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mgrep[0m  searches  for  [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by newline characters,[m
       and [1mgrep[0m prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep[0m is used in  a[m
       shell command.[m
[m
       A  [4mFILE[24m  of  “[1m-[0m”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches examine the working[m
       directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.[m
[m
       Debian also includes the variant programs [1megrep[0m, [1mfgrep[0m and [1mrgrep[0m.  These programs are  the  same  as  [1mgrep[0m [1m-E[0m,[m
       [1mgrep[0m [1m-F[0m,  and [1mgrep[0m [1m-r[0m, respectively.  These variants are deprecated upstream, but Debian provides for backward[m
       compatibility. For portability reasons, it is recommended to avoid the variant programs, and use [1mgrep[0m with the[m
       related option instead.[m

[?2004lThe Oracle," Yes, he disappeared some time ago. We did not know what happened to him until now. He’s being held prisoner by a very dangerous program, one of the oldest of us. He is called the Merovingian, and he will not let him go willingly."
Morpheus," Yes, we are here to speak with the Merovingian."
Merovingian," Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu’elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm… of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances."
Merovingian," Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite – fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d’enculés de ta mère. You see, it’s like wiping your arse with silk, I love it."
Merovingian," Hmph… I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.’ The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do… what?"
Merovingian," But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth"
Merovingian," No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.’ `Why’ is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why’ is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,’ without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all."
Merovingian," Please, ma chérie, I’ve told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir."
Merovingian," Oh God, my God, Persephone how could you do this, you betrayed me [speaking French]!"
Merovingian," Cause? There is no cause for this, what cause?"
Merovingian," Lipstick? Lipstick? What craziness you are talking about woman, there is no lipstick."
Merovingian," Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai, woman, this is nothing, c’est rien, c’est rien du tout. It’s a game, it is only a game."
Merovingian," All right. All right. Let us find out where this goes. You two, get the Keymaker."
Merovingian," Handle us? You’ll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect."
Merovingian," Okay, you have some skill. Kill him."
Merovingian," You see, he’s just a man."
Merovingian," Damn it, woman, you will be the end of me. Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you!"

Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.’ `Why’ is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why’ is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,’ without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all."
Merovingian," Please, ma chérie, I’ve told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir."
Merovingian," Oh God, my God, Persephone how could you do this, you betrayed me [speaking French]!"
Merovingian," Cause? There is no cause for this, what cause?"
Merovingian," Lipstick? Lipstick? What craziness you are talking about woman, there is no lipstick."
Merovingian," Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai, woman, this is nothing, c’est rien, c’est rien du tout. It’s a game, it is only a game."
Merovingian," All right. All right. Let us find out where this goes. You two, get the Keymaker."
Merovingian," Handle us? You’ll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect."
Merovingian," Okay, you have some skill. Kill him."
Merovingian," You see, he’s just a man."
Merovingian," Damn it, woman, you will be the end of me. Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you!"

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mgrep[0m  searches  for  [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by newline characters,[m
       and [1mgrep[0m prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep[0m is used in  a[m
       shell command.[m
[m
       A  [4mFILE[24m  of  “[1m-[0m”  stands  for  standard  input.   If  no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches examine the working[m
       directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.[m
[m
       Debian also includes the variant programs [1megrep[0m, [1mfgrep[0m and [1mrgrep[0m.  These programs are  the  same  as  [1mgrep[0m [1m-E[0m,[m
       [1mgrep[0m [1m-F[0m,  and [1mgrep[0m [1m-r[0m, respectively.  These variants are deprecated upstream, but Debian provides for backward[m
       compatibility. For portability reasons, it is recommended to avoid the variant programs, and use [1mgrep[0m with the[m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [4mSed[24m  is  a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a[m
       file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits (such as[m
       [4med[24m), [4msed[24m works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient.  But it is [4msed[24m's[m
       ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types of editors.[m

Merovingian," Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu’elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm… of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances."
Merovingian," Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite – fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d’enculés de ta mère. You see, it’s like wiping your arse with silk, I love it."
Merovingian," Hmph… I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.’ The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do… what?"
Merovingian," But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth"
Merovingian," No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.’ `Why’ is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why’ is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,’ without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all."
Merovingian," Please, ma chérie, I’ve told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir."
Merovingian," Oh God, my God, Persephone how could you do this, you betrayed me [speaking French]!"
Merovingian," Cause? There is no cause for this, what cause?"
Merovingian," Lipstick? Lipstick? What craziness you are talking about woman, there is no lipstick."
Merovingian," Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai, woman, this is nothing, c’est rien, c’est rien du tout. It’s a game, it is only a game."
Merovingian," All right. All right. Let us find out where this goes. You two, get the Keymaker."
Merovingian," Handle us? You’ll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect."
Merovingian," Okay, you have some skill. Kill him."
Merovingian," You see, he’s just a man."
Merovingian," Damn it, woman, you will be the end of me. Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you!"

Merovingian," Aha, here he is at last. Neo, the One himself, right? And the legendary Morpheus. And Trinity of course, si belle qu’elle me fait souffrir. I have heard so much, you honour me. Please, sit, join us. This is my wife, Persephone. Something to eat? Drink? Hmm… of course, such things are contrivances like so much here. For the sake of appearances."
Merovingian," Yes, of course, who has time? Who has time? But then if we do not ever take time, how can we ever have time? Château Haut-Brion 1959, magnificent wine, I love French wine, like I love the French language. I have sampled every language, French is my favourite – fantastic language, especially to curse with. Nom de Dieu de putain de bordel de merde de saloperies de connards d’enculés de ta mère. You see, it’s like wiping your arse with silk, I love it."
Merovingian," Hmph… I am a trafficker of information, I know everything I can. The question is, do you know why you are here?"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is true. The Keymaker, of course. But this is not a reason, this is not a `why.’ The Keymaker himself, his very nature, is means, it is not an end, and so, to look for him is to be looking for a means to do… what?"
Merovingian," But do you? You think you do but you do not. You are here because you were sent here, you were told to come here and you obeyed. [Laughs] It is, of course, the way of all things. You see, there is only one constant, one universal, it is the only real truth"
Merovingian," No. Wrong. Choice is an illusion, created between those with power, and those without. Look there, at that woman. My God, just look at her. Affecting everyone around her, so obvious, so bourgeois, so boring. But wait… Watch – you see, I have sent her dessert, a very special dessert. I wrote it myself. It starts so simply, each line of the program creating a new effect, just like poetry. First, a rush… heat… her heart flutters. You can see it, Neo, yes? She does not understand why – is it the wine? No. What is it then, what is the reason? And soon it does not matter, soon the why and the reason are gone, and all that matters is the feeling itself. This is the nature of the universe. We struggle against it, we fight to deny it, but it is of course pretense, it is a lie. Beneath our poised appearance, the truth is we are completely out of control. Causality. There is no escape from it, we are forever slaves to it. Our only hope, our only peace is to understand it, to understand the `why.’ `Why’ is what separates us from them, you from me. `Why’ is the only real social power, without it you are powerless. And this is how you come to me, without `why,’ without power. Another link in the chain. But fear not, since I have seen how good you are at following orders, I will tell you what to do next. Run back, and give the fortune teller this message"
Merovingian," Oh yes, it is. The Keymaker is mine and I see no reason why I should give him up. No reason at all."
Merovingian," Please, ma chérie, I’ve told you, we are all victims of causality. I drink too much wine, I must take a piss. Cause and effect. Au revoir."
Merovingian," Oh God, my God, Persephone how could you do this, you betrayed me [speaking French]!"
Merovingian," Cause? There is no cause for this, what cause?"
Merovingian," Lipstick? Lipstick? What craziness you are talking about woman, there is no lipstick."
Merovingian," Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai, woman, this is nothing, c’est rien, c’est rien du tout. It’s a game, it is only a game."
Merovingian," All right. All right. Let us find out where this goes. You two, get the Keymaker."
Merovingian," Handle us? You’ll handle us? You know, your predecessors had much more respect."
Merovingian," Okay, you have some skill. Kill him."
Merovingian," You see, he’s just a man."
Merovingian," Damn it, woman, you will be the end of me. Mark my words, boy, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you!"
