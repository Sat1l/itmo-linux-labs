[captain]:  Squiddies got all our best spots.
Ballard:  What are we gonna do about it?
Niobe:  We’re gonna do what Commander Lock ordered us to do. We’ll evacuate broadcast level and return to Zion.
Smith:  I’m looking for Neo.
Corrupt:  Never heard of him.
Corrupt:  Fine, whatever. Now piss off.
Wurm:  How did you know someone was here?
Corrupt:  He gave you this. He said you set him free.
Wurm:  Is everything all right, sir?
Neo:  The meeting is over, retreat to your exits. Agents are coming.
